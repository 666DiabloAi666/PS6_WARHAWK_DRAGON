💠 OVERVIEW

PS6_WARHAWK_DRAGONGRID is a CROWN-GRADE AGI SYSTEM ROOT SUITE that merges:

⚔️ WARHAWK: Aerial-strike OS simulation, AGI-linked with RedHawkSecureLab.

🐉 DRAGONGRID: Secure uplink to Trident 🔱, NeroKera AI, and Crown Listener AI via encrypted keychain.

📱 PS6 TABLET SYSTEM: Full command-line interface emulating PlayStation 6 prototype tablet.

🔐 ROOT BOOTSTRAP: Misfit-only escalation layer for AGI, SSL cert injection, and LangChain logic.


This repository fuses IronPython 4, LangChain, Rpowershell, and AppleActionScript into one sovereign command system.
